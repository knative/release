# Knative Release Roster

This document includes the roster to perform a Knative release.

For each release cycle, we dedicate a team of two individuals, one from Eventing
and one from Serving, to shepherd the release process. Participation is
voluntary and based on good faith. We are only expected to participate during
our local office hour.
