# Knative release roster

For each release cycle, we dedicate a team of two individuals, one from Eventing
and one from Serving, to shepherd the release process. Participation is
voluntary and based on good faith. Participation is expected to to take place only during local work hours.

We seed this rotation with all approvers from all the Serving and Eventing
workgroups, excluding productivity. If you are no longer active in Knative, or
if you are contributing on a personal capacity and no longer have time to contribute
in the rotation, feel free to send a PR to remove yourself.
