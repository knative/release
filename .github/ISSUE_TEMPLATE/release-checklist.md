# Timeline of a Knative release

We release each repository of `knative.dev` roughly every 3 months. Please check the [release schedule](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/README.md#release-schedule) to calculate when to start work on each checkpoint of a release timeline.

## Repos to be released

- All repos to be released are listed in this document
- Each repo indicates its releasability and other statuses, when applicable
- Each repo needs to be successfully updated to use the latest version of all dependencies **before** cutting its release branch

### T-minus 30 days

- [ ] Release leads have been updated for the upcoming release (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#permissions-for-release-leads))
  - See workflow to check rollout: [![Owner Workflow](https://github.com/knative/release/actions/workflows/check-owners.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/knative/release/actions/workflows/check-owners.yaml)

### T-minus 14 days

- [ ] Update release version in the following workflows

  - [ ] Releasability (see: [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#updating-the-releasability-defaults))
  - [ ] Update Dependency (see: [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#bump-dependencies-in-auto-update-job))

- [ ] An announcement has been made in the [**#knative**](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C04LGHDR9K7) Slack channel that [`knative.dev/pkg`](https://github.com/knative/pkg) will be released in a week

### T-minus 7 days - releasing supporting repos

Guidance on [releasing a repository](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#releasing-a-repository).

- [ ] An announcement has been made in the [**#knative**](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C04LGHDR9K7) Slack channel that the cut of [`knative.dev/pkg`](https://github.com/knative/pkg) is imminent
- [ ] Check the status of the nightly builds. See the badge against each core repo in Phase 1. Let the [working group leads](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) know about failures and ask them to investigate.Repeat this process throughout the week. This should not be a blocker to start cutting the supporting repositories mentioned below.

Notes

- Some of the supporting repos can be cut in parallel. Refer [Aligning dependencies](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md/#Aligning-dependencies).
- The release branch for each supporting repos must be done only after the branch for their dependencies is cut.

#### Cut Supporting Repositories

- [knative/hack](https://github.com/knative/hack)
  - [ ] Branch Cut
- [knative/pkg](https://github.com/knative/pkg)
  - [ ] Dependencies up to date - [![releasabilty][pkg-release-badge]][pkg-release-workflow]
  - [ ] Branch Cut
- [knative/networking](https://github.com/knative/networking)
  - [ ] Dependencies up to date - [![releasabilty][networking-release-badge]][networking-release-workflow]
  - [ ] Branch Cut
- [knative/caching](https://github.com/knative/caching)
  - [ ] Dependencies up to date - [![releasabilty][caching-release-badge]][caching-release-workflow]
  - [ ] Branch Cut
- [knative-extensions/reconciler-test](https://github.com/knative-extensions/reconciler-test)
  - [ ] Dependencies up to date - [![releasabilty][reconciler-test-release-badge]][reconciler-test-release-workflow]
  - [ ] Branch Cut

### T-minus 1 day

- [ ] Obtained ACK from each [working group lead](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) that the release is imminent and is green-lighted.

- [ ] Re-check for status of the nightly releases and notify [working group leads](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) of failures. Repeat until all are passing.

### Release Day(s)

- If no acknowledgement is received from any of the WGL, send another message on slack and start working on the release after sometime.
- Review the [PROCEDURE](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#releasing-a-repository) on how to release a repo.
  Notes
- It is not required that all repos in the included sub-sections be released on the same day the release is scheduled to start.
- The release notes of a dependency are not a blocker for proceeding to cut a release for a repo.
- The prow job web page is very slow to respond and you need to click only once to rerun the job.
- Some repos can be released in parallel.Refer [Aligning dependencies](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#Aligning-dependencies).

#### Final Phase

- [ ] Talk to Vincent (Operator WG Lead) and have him cut (or help you cut) the [knative/operator](https://github.com/knative/operator) [![Releases][operator-version-badge]][operator-release-page]
- [ ] Knative Client Homebrew has been updated (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#homebrew-client))
- [ ] Knative Client Plugins Homebrew has been updated (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#homebrew-kn-plugins))

### Post Release - after operator is cut

- [ ] Release the knative.dev/docs (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#releasing-a-new-version-of-the-knative-documentation))
- [ ] Release schedule has been updated in [RELEASE-SCHEDULE.md](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/RELEASE-SCHEDULE.md) and [README.md](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/README.md)
- [ ] Collect release notes into the blog post and publish it (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#updating-the-release-schedule))
- [ ] Knobots update-deps job has been bumped to the next release version (see [procedure](https://github.com/knative/release/blob/main/PROCEDURES.md#bump-dependencies-in-auto-update-job))
- [ ] An announcement was made in the [**#knative**](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C04LGHDR9K7) Slack channels that the new Knative release is out
- [ ] Document any change(s) needed to improve the release process
